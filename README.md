# human-race-chromesome-damage

the human race has been consuming sucralose (splenda type sweetner) since 1976 and its possible the human race has a slight increase in genetic mutations when offspring are born each generation

the human race should only allow non-mutative human beings without major deficit to their physisology to reproduce to produce offspring

or the human race risks compounding the problem of more mutative problems
